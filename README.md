Biol525D
=======

Topics in Systematics and Evolution:
Bioinformatics for Evolutionary Biology



- See the [syllabus](https://github.com/owensgl/biol525D/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md) for an overview of the course.


- Each topic folder contains the lecture slides, as well as a markdown document used for coding examples. 


- If you need a quick refresher (or some help getting up to speed) on working with a Unix system, take a look at the [unix help](https://github.com/owensgl/biol525D/blob/master/resources/unix_ref.pdf) file. There are some resources there that will help you find the specific command you need for each task. 


##DATA REPOSITORY##

All example data used in the class will be found on your Amazon AWS server. 

##NAVIGATING THIS SITE##

- To access a file or directory, click that file or directory on the far left, directly over the name of the resource. If you click the message in the middle of the page, that shows what was changed in the commit, which is not what you want to look at.

##OBTAINING ALL THE FILES ON THIS SITE##

The following is an up-to-date zip archive: https://github.com/owensgl/biol525D/archive/master.zip

This method dosesn't require `git`, however, you'll have to manually update the files this way (by downloading the whole repo again).

A better method is to use `git`. To obtain to all the files, type:

    git clone https://github.com/owensgl/biol525D.git

To update the all the files at any point in the future, change to the **biol525D** directory that was created by the previous command and type:

    git pull
