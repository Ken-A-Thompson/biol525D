##RESOURCES##

**All of the following materials are available under the *resources* directory. You can follow the links in the text to find each resource.**

- See the [syllabus](https://) for an overview of the course.

The [programs](https://) file has a listing of the software used for each exercise.

- The slides, commands, or any other information for each topic are under a directory for that topic. For example, the directory "[Topic01](https://)" contains information for topic 1, the directory "[Topic02](https://)" contains information for topic 2, and so on.

   - There are two directories for each topic, one for the lecture and one for the exercises.

- If you need a quick refresher (or some help getting up to speed) on working with a Unix system, take a look at the [unix help](https://) file. There are some resources there that will help you find the specific command you need for each task.
