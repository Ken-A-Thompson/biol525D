# Topic 1: Logging into the server.

We are working on servers provided by Compute Canada, hosted on the [WestCloud](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/national-services/compute-canada-cloud/) system. The only task now is to install a few programs we'll need later on, and login to your account.

Programs to install: 
* [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/)
* [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en)

Log into WestCloud server using ssh (terminal). You will find your username and ip address in this [table](). 
```bash
ssh  -v  <your_user_name>@<your_server_ip>
```

Your screen should look like this:
