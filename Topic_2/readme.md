#Navigating the directory structure
There are a few basic commands needed to move around the unix directory structure
* *pwd* : _Print working directory_. This tells you where you currently are in the directory structure.
* *mkdir* : _Make directory_. This makes a new directory where you specify.
* *cd* : _Change directory_. This moves you to a new directory.
* *ls* : _List directory contents_. This tells you what is in a directory.
